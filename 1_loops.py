# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
# print(fruits[0])
# print(fruits[1])
# print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
#i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
for subject in subjects:
    print(subject)
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"


# Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
